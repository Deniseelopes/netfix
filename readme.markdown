# NETFIX: A Chrome Extension to fix the Netfix UI



## Changes
- Changes movie link to its page and not instant play (Especially nice for TV links, but handy to read reviews and such)
- Changes the sliders on the homepage to a regular div with "show/hide" links for excess videos
- Hides movies with a predicted rating under 2.5 stars unless you're looking for a particular actor/director
- Hides, on the homepage, movies you've rated before
- Displays star ratings on the movies directly
